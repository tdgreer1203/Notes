  ## Description
------
I wanted to create a note-taking app using the material we learned in class over Express JS. With this app, I specifically wanted to better understand routing, and how to modularize routes for an application. Although I only had a need for a single object type, I modularized the routes anyways, as if I were going to have multiple api types. 

I chose this project to work on my understanding of Express JS, and the concept of routing. This project seemed fairly easy and straightforward, while at the same time, having enough functionality to be challenging to me as I was trying to better understand Express JS.

The code itself solves the problem of not storage. Because this application has been deployed to Heroku, if I would like, I can navigate to the Heroku URL, and use this application in production. This app solves the problem of not having a place to store my notes, that can be easily accessed across multiple devices. 

As intended, I got a much better understanding of Express JS. Before completing this application, I was really struggling with undestanding route modularization, and core conecepts in Express JS. After completing the different portions of this application, I now feel I have a much better understanding of these concepts.
